# How to use our model

All the shell codes used are place in the root directory of this repository.

## Data Installation

The fastest way to get all the data required without compiling any C++ code is to run the following script:

```shell
chmod +x simple.sh
./simple.sh
```

To learn more about the installation details, you may read [this](install.md).

## Model Training

After data installation, you can run the following command to train the model:

```shell
# TODO
```

If it's too time consuming to train the model, you can download the pre-trained model with our script:

```shell
# TODO
```

Still, you need some extra fine-tuning to make the model work with your data. Usually, you can get an not-so-bad result with 10-20 epochs of fine-tuning.

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model, you can run the following command:

```shell
# TODO
```

You may also evaluate the model by submitting the results to the competition website. Note that you may not get an expected high score as we have in the competition, since we have used some extra data and techniques based on heuristics to improve the score, which are not presented in this repository because they are not the core part of the model, just some tricks used in practice.
